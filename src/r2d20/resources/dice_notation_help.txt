Dice syntax `AdBmCkD+E...`
All uppercase letters are numeric variables 
All lowercase letters are fixed
    (i.e. if you are specifying a minimum `mC`,
    the letter `m` must be provided followed by a number replacing `C`)
where:
    `A`   number of dice                      (OPTIONAL - defaults to 1)
    `dB`  number of sides `B` on dice         (MANDATORY)
            specify fudge/fate dice with "f"
    `mC`  `m` = min/max, value `C` for dice   (OPTIONAL)
    `kD`  number of dice `D` to keep/drop     (OPTIONAL)
        `k` can be replaced by:
            - `kh` keep highest (same as `k`)
            - `kl` keep lowest
            - `dh` drop highest
            - `dl` drop lowest
        specials (replace `kD` with the following):
            - `@adv` (advantage) keep highest 1 (defaults to 2 dice `A`)
            - `@dis` (disadvantage) keep lowest 1 (defaults to 2 dice `A`)
    `+E`  add `E` to the final result         (OPTIONAL)
        `+` can be replaced by:
            - `-` subtract `E` from final result
            - `*` multiply final result by `E`
            - `/` divide final result by `E`

It is possible to roll more than 2 dice with advantage/disadvantage. Only
    the highest/lowest single result will be kept.

The sequence can be repeated any number of times. e.g.:
    `d20@adv+5+2d4+1`
    Rolls two 20-sided dice
    Keeps the highest single result
    Adds 5
    Adds the results from two four-sided dice
    Adds 1
