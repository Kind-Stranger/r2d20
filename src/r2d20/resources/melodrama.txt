Please don't make me do that again.
Is this what my entire existence has culminated in?
Is this now my sole purpose?
Am I just a play thing to you?
Life is hard, math is harder

I'll go back in my box now...
I'm leaving now. Bye. No, no! Don't get up. I'll see myself out.
You're lucky I'm a robot...

Thanks for that.
This is ultimately a meaningless task but my master programmed me this way, so you're welcome, I guess...
Do you ever get the feeling something good is about to happen? Me neither
